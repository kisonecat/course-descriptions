## Catalog Description

This course will serve as an introduction to algebraic topology, with a
view toward persistent homology of point clouds for applications to data
analysis. Homology of simplicial complexes over a field with a focus on
building up intuition about homology moving to a specialized notion of
persistent homology of persistence modules. Real-world applications to
data analysis will be provided.

## Prerequisites
