## Topics List

1.  One-dimensional flows: geometric way of thinking; fixed points and
    stability; population growth and other applications.

2.  Bifurcations in one-dimensional flows: saddle-node, transcritical
    and pitchfork bifurcations; imperfect bifurcations.

3.  Theory: existence; uniqueness; continuous dependence.

4.  Phase planes: phase portraits; vector fields; nullclines; fixed
    points; stability;

5.  Linear systems: classification of linear systems; what do linear
    systems say about the nonlinear system?

6.  Limit cycles; introduction; Poincare-Bendixson theorem; conservative
    systems.

7.  Bifurcations of two-dimensional flows; Hopf bifurcation theorem.

8.  XPPAUT: phase planes; bifurcations; applications.

9.  Global bifurcations: homoclinic orbits; Poincare map; stability of
    periodic orbits.

10. Singular perturbations: Relaxation oscillators; averaging.

11. One-dimensional maps: Logistic map.
