## Catalog Description

Enumerative techniques, combinatorial identities, graph theory,
algorithms, error correcting codes

## Purpose

Combinatorics and discrete mathematics are increasingly important,
particularly for their applications in computer science. This course
will give a brief overview of this subject.

## Topics List

1.  Counting principles: factorials, permutations and combinations,
    binomial coefficients, Stirling numbers, double counting.
2.  Combinatorial identities: bijections, binomial theorem, generating
