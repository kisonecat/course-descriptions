and Laplace equations; applications.

## Prerequisite

C- or better in 2173, 2153, 2162.xx, 2182H, or 4182H; or credit for
254.xx, 263.xx, 263.01H, or 264H. Intended for undergraduate and master
degree students in Engineering and Science.

### Exclusions

Not open to students with credit for 4557, 512, or 557.

Not open to students with a math major, math minor or actuarial science
major.

## Purpose of Course

This course develops problem solving skills with little emphasis on
theory. Students should be able to solve the PDE's and ODE's and
interpret the solution.
