## Catalog Description

4580-4581 includes group theory, ring theory, vector spaces over
arbitrary fields, and field theory.

## Prerequisite

C- or better in 3345, or 3345H and C- or better in 2568 or 2568H or
5520H

**[Purpose]{.underline}**:

Math 4580-4581 constitutes a two-semester sequence on abstract algebra,
intended to introduce students the main concepts of this subject area.
Focused on groups, rings and fields, this course gives the students a
deep understanding of these three basic algebraic structures, and
provides a good foundation for more specialized work. A significant goal
of the course is to improve mathematical reasoning and proof writing.

Math 4580 presents special classes of groups, group actions on sets,
vector spaces, and field theory that concludes with elements of Galois
theory. The course places these topics in their historical context where
possible.
