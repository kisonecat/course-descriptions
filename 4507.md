## Catalog Description

Topics in Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic geometries. Connections
to high school mathematics, calculus, and the theory of groups are
emphasized.

## Prerequisite

C- or better in 3345 and in C- or better in 2568 or 5520H; or credit for
345, and credit for 568, 571, or 520H; or graduate standing.

## Text

Open-source textbook:

A workbook of two-dimensional geometries, Clemens and Snapp.

## Purpose

Starting from questions accessible to Euclid, this course treats
Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic geometry from a unified point of
view.

To encourage the student to become a "do-er" of mathematics, in this
course essentially write their own "textbook," as the proofs of a
majority of the theorems are left to the student.

## Topics List

1.  Neutral geometry.

2.  Euclidean geometry.

3.  Spherical geometry.

4.  Hyperbolic geometry.
